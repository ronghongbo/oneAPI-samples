# `BLAS`

This directory contains FPGA reference designs for the standard BLAS kernels defined in [oneMKL](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneMKL/domains/blas/blas.html). The row-major, USM-based SYCL interface is supported.

To reduce engineering efforts, kernels with similar computes are grouped so that a single systolic array can be built and reconfigured to cover each kernel in the group, without losing performance. Below are the kernels supported, with one table for one group:

## `Level 1 kernels`


| Kernel            | Formula                           | Description                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| $\mathbf{dot}$    | $\vec{X}\cdot \vec{Y}$            |           |
| $\mathbf{sdsdot}$ | $sb+\vec{X}\cdot \vec{Y}$         |  |
| $\mathbf{dotc}$   | $\overline{\vec{X}}\cdot \vec{Y}$ |        |
| $\mathbf{dotu}$   | $\vec{X}\cdot \vec{Y}$            |         |
| $\mathbf{nrm2}$   | $\|\vec{X}\|$                     |           |




## `Level 2 kernels`


## `Level 3 kernels`

 Kernel          | Formula             | Description       |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| $\mathbf{gemm}$ | $\alpha AB+\beta C$ |            |
| $\mathbf{symm}$ | $\alpha AB+\beta C$ |  |
| $\mathbf{hemm}$ | $\alpha HB+\beta C$ |  |
| $\mathbf{syrk}$ | $\alpha AA^T+\beta C$ |    |
| $\mathbf{herk}$ | $\alpha AA^H+\beta C$ |    |
 

## `File structure`

All the kernels are put under the `blas` directory. Every kernel has the following files under it:

* `api.hpp` - The API to invoke the kernel in any SYCL application.
* `test.cpp` - Unit tests for correctness, adapted from [oneMKL's test suite](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneMKL/blob/develop/tests/unit_tests/blas/), with slight changes to respect the row-major layout and the sizes of the reconfigurable systolic arrays.
* `demo.cpp` - Demonstrating how to invoke the kernel.
* `CMakeLists.txt` - A cmake script.
* `README.md` - A short description of the kernel.

The shared systolic arrays (named as `reconfigurable-*`) are also under the `blas` directory. Every systolic array has the following files under it:
* `api.hpp` - The API to invoke the systolic array.
* `spec.cpp`: A brief description of the systolic array and other optimizations for it in the [T2SP language](https://github.com/IntelLabs/t2sp). From this specification, SYCL files will be generated by the T2SP compiler. The SYCL files are then synthesized into a bitstream for an FPGA hardware.
* `parameters.h` : Sizes and data types of the systolic array.
* `CMakeLists.txt` - A cmake script.
* `README.md` - A short description of the systolic array.

## Build a kernel and run on Linux

1. Configure the build system.

   ```shell
   cd KERNEL # Replace this with the specific kernel's name, e.g. gemm
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   ```
   
For Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA:
   ```shell  
   cmake ..
   ```

For **Intel Stratix® 10 SX**:
   ```shell
   cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Test correctness.

   ```shell
   make tests
   ../bin/test_* # Replace * with specific test ID like 0, 1, ...
   ```

Each test builds a tiny-scale systolic array and runs on an FPGA emulator.

3. Test performance

Each kernel usually has several variations, depending on the the precision. For example, `gemm` has 4 precisions supported,  `s` (single-precision), `d`(double-precision), `c`(complex single-precision), and `z`(complex double-precision), and correspondingly, 4 variations: `sgemm`, `dgemm`, `cgemm` and `zgemm`.

    ```shell
    # Replace the VARIATION below with a specific variation of the kernel
    make demo_VARIATION_(tiny|large)_(a10|s10)
    ../bin/demo_VARIATION_(tiny|large)_(a10|s10)
    ```

Take `sgemm` for example:
   ```shell
   # Generate a demo application.
   make demo_sgemm_large_a10

   # Demo on the hardware
   ../bin/demo_sgemm_large_a10
   ``` 
Note that `sgemm` actually involkes a reconfigurable systolic array. When building the demo for `sgemm` as shown above, that array will be automatically synthesized, if not yet.
