    "## SYCL Thread Mapping\n",
    "The SYCL* execution model exposes an abstract view of GPU execution. The SYCL thread hierarchy consists of a 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional grid of work-items. These work-items are grouped into equal sized thread groups called work-groups. Threads in a work-group are further divided into equal sized vector groups called sub-groups (see the illustration that follows).\n",
    "#### Work-item\n",
    "A work-item represents one of a collection of parallel executions of a kernel.\n",
    "#### Sub-group\n",
    "A sub-group represents a short range of consecutive work-items that are processed together as a SIMD vector of length 8, 16, 32, or a multiple of the native vector length of a CPU with Intel® UHD Graphics.\n",
    "#### Work-group\n",
    "A work-group is a 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional set of threads within the thread hierarchy. In SYCL, synchronization across work-items is only possible with barriers for the work-items within the same work-group.\n",
    "### nd_range\n",
    "An nd_range divides the thread hierarchy into 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional grids of work-groups. It is represented by the global range, the local range of each work-group.\n",

    "```cpp\n",

    "      cgh.parallel_for(sycl::range<3>(64, 64, 128), // global range\n",

    "      })\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This kernel contains 524,288 work-items structured as a 3D range of 64 x 64 x 128. It leaves the work-group and sub-group size selection to the compiler. To fully utilize the 5376 parallel operations available in the Xe-LP TGL GPU, the compiler must choose a proper work group size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most important GPU resources are:\n",
    "- __Thread Contexts:__\n",
    "The kernel should have a sufficient number of threads to utilize the GPU’s thread contexts.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a SYCL kernel, the programmer can affect the work distribution by structuring the kernel with proper work-group size, sub-group size, and organizing the work-items for efficient vector execution. Writing efficient vector kernels is covered in a separate section. This chapter focuses on work-group and sub-group size selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread contexts are easier to utilize than SIMD vector. Therefore, start with selecting the number of threads in a work-group. Each Xe-core has 112 thread contexts, but usually you cannot use all the threads if the kernel is also vectorized by 8 (112 x 8 = 896 > 512). From this, we can derive that the maximum number of threads in a work-group is 64 (512 / 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "SYCL does not provide a mechanism to directly set the number of threads in a work-group. However, you can use work-group size and SIMD sub-group size to set the number of threads:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Work group size = Threads x SIMD sub-group size\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can increase the sub-group size as long as there are a sufficient number of registers for the kernel after widening. Note that each XVE has 128 SIMD8 registers so there is a lot of room for widening on simple kernels. The effect of increasing sub-group size is similar to loop unrolling: while each XVE still executes eight 32-bit operations per cycle, the amount of work per work-group interaction is doubled/quadrupled. In SYCL, a programmer can explicitly specify sub-group size using `intel::reqd_sub_group_size({8|16|32})` to override the compiler’s selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below summarizes the selection criteria of threads and sub-group sizes to keep all GPU resources occupied for TGL:\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurations to ensure full occupancy\n",

    "Maximum Threads | Minimum Sub-group Size | Maximum Sub-group Size | Maximum Work-group Size | Constraint\n",
    ":-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-\n",
    "64 | 8 | 32 | 512 | Threads x sub-group size <= 512\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our example program, if you choose a work-group size less than 64 for sub-group size 8, less than 128 for sub-group size 16, or less than 256 for sub-group size 32, the application will not be able to fully utilize TGL GPU’s thread contexts. Choosing a larger work-group size has the additional advantage of reducing the number of rounds of work-group dispatching."

    "This kernel is similar to the previous example, except it requires work-group barrier synchronization. Work-item synchronization is only available to work-items within the same work-group. You must pick a work-group local range using nd_range and nd_item. Because synchronization is implemented using a Xe-core’s SLM for shared variables, all the work-items of a work-group must be allocated to the same Xe-core, which affects Xe-core occupancy and kernel performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this kernel, the local range of work-group is given as range(1, R, 128). Assuming the sub-group size is eight, let’s look at how the values of variable R affect XVE occupancy. In the case of R=1, the local group range is (1, 1, 128) and work-group size is 128. The Xe-core allocated for a work-group contains only 16 threads out of 112 available thread contexts (i.e., very low occupancy). However, the system can dispatch 7 work-groups to the same Xe-core to reach full occupancy at the expense of a higher number of dispatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of R>4, the work-group size will exceed the system-supported maximum work-group size of 512, and the kernel will fail to launch. In the case of R=4, an Xe-core is only 57% occupied (4/7) and the three unused thread contexts are not sufficient to accommodate another work-group, wasting 43% of the available XVE capacities. Note that the driver may still be able to dispatch a partial work-group to an unused Xe-core. However, because of the barrier in the kernel, the partially dispatched work items would not be able to pass the barriers until the rest of the work group is dispatched. In most cases, the kernel’s performance would not benefit much from the partial dispatch. Hence, it is important to avoid this problem by properly choosing the work-group size.\n",

    "In summary, a SYCL work-group is typically dispatched to an Xe-core. All the work-items in a work-group shares the same SLM of an Xe-core for intra work-group thread barriers and memory fence synchronization. Multiple work-groups can be dispatched to the same Xe-core if there are sufficient XVE ALUs, SLM, and thread contexts to accommodate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can achieve higher performance by fully utilizing all available Xe-cores. Parameters affecting a kernel’s GPU occupancy are work-group size and SIMD sub-group size, which also determines the number of threads in the work-group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Intel® GPU Occupancy Calculator](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneAPI-samples/Tools/GPU-Occupancy-Calculator/index.html) can be used to calculate the occupancy on an Intel GPU for a given kernel, and its work-group parameters."
